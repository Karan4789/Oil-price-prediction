# Oil Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict oil prices based on historical data. The model leverages time series forecasting techniques to provide insights into future price trends.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of time series forecasting models
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- Future price prediction

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/oil-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd oil-price-prediction
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run the notebook step by step to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Model Details

- The model is trained using a time series forecasting approach, such as ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet.
- Hyperparameters are optimized to enhance accuracy.
- The model is evaluated based on metrics like RMSE and MAE.

## Future Improvements

- **Model tuning required for future predictions:** The current model might need hyperparameter adjustments and retraining to adapt to market fluctuations.
- **Integration of additional economic indicators** for improved prediction accuracy.
- **Deployment as an API or web application** for real-time price forecasting.
